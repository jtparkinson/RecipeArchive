title: Simple Lemonade/Limeade
description: A simple, modular recipe for lemonade and limeade. More of a ratio of ingredients, really
---
### Ingredients
- 4 cups water
- 1 cup lemon/lime juice
- 3/4 cup sugar/stevia blend/Torani’s Sugar-Free simple syrup
- Optionally, 2-4 limes or lemons to infuse
### Instructions
- Mix thoroughly
- Roughly chop limes/lemons, leave in water to infuse for 1-2 hours
### Yields
- ~5-6 cups lemonade/limeade
### Notes
- This isn’t really a full recipe, but it’s a good baseline lemonade or limeade ratio.
 - This comes out just a tiny bit tart, which makes it a great base for adding other flavors via syrups and purees.
 - Infusing the recipe with freshly-chopped lemons or limes lets you add some of the flavors of the peel and pith to the drink. It gives it a real depth of flavor!
 - Some flavors, like mint, melon, or cucumber, can also be added via infusion
 - Other flavors, like berries, are better to add via a syrup-- just boil them with some water and the sweetener of your choice until you get a thick syrup and strain it into your drink through a fine mesh sieve (or a cheesecloth to get a clean, particulate-free result)
