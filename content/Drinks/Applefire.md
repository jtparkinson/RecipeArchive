title: Applefire
description: A fiery drink made with apple juice, ginger beer, and a spicy syrup
---
### Ingredients
- 6c Apple Juice (I typically use low-sugar)
- 6c strong Ginger Ale/Beer (I prefer Diet Bundaberg Ginger Beer)
- 2T Water
- 2T Torani’s Brown Sugar Cinnamon Syrup
- 1T Cayenne
- 1/2T - 1T Any Blend of Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmeg, and Allspice
### Instructions
- Boil together Water, Syrup, Cayenne, and Spices until they form a syrup
- Strain the resultant syrup through a cheesecloth and a fine mesh strainer to remove as much particulate as possible
- Mix Apple Juice and Ginger Ale/Beer with syrup
### Yields
- 12c Applefire
### Notes
- The longer you cook the syrup, the better the liquid will absorb the spices, but if you cook it too long, it can result in a slurry rather than a syrup. If the resultant mixture doesn’t fit through your cheesecloth, add some water and bring it back to a boil before straining through.
