title: Baja Sauce
description: A sour cream based taco sauce
---
### Ingredients
- 1 c sour cream (I use light)
- 2 tsp lime juice
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- ½ tsp salt (omit if using onion salt or garlic salt instead of powder
### Instructions
- Mix ‘em up
### Yields
- 1.1 c Baja Sauce
### Notes
- These are all ballpark numbers at the time of this writing. I will make this soon and update the recipe
- Add a bit of Chipotle Adobo for a spicy version
- If you dilute this with just a bit of water, it can be easier to use in a squirt-top sauce bottle, and more like the consistency of most taco sauces
